Excuse me, officer. I think I know can you help me find my hotel, please? Certainly. What's the name of your hotel? It's the grammar bank hotel. I think I know where it is. Is it far? No, not really. Do you have a car? Are you driving? No, I don't have a car. Okay. Actually it's about ten minutes walk, but if you want I can call you a cab. No, thank you. I don't mind walking. Okay, then let me give you the directions. Thank you, I appreciate that. Now go along the street until you get to the bank. Do you see the Tall building? Yeah. So at the traffic lights there, turn left on Great Chevy Avenue. Okay, I will turn left. Correct. Then go straight on, take the second right, and then should take you to the Grammar Bank Hotel. Okay, I will take the second left. No, it's the second right. Oh, right, the second right. Yes, sir. Left at the traffic lights near the bank and then the second right. That's it. Thank you very much for your help. No problem. Have a nice day. Thank you. Bye.
