Yeah, you know, one of the things is just realizing that putting down our social media is hard. It is difficult because in many ways our social media is like a drug. Every time we get that buzzer beep, we get a quick dopamine hit and it's almost like the gambler who it gets that dopamine hit and you think like, oh my gosh, this email I'm getting, it might finally be that email I was waiting for to tell me I got this big award. This is the email that's going to change everything. Yeah. And usually it's another spam risk or something like this, but that dopamine hit is actually much different than the longer lasting serotonin lift we get from social connections. But we've kind of got to go over that hump of like, okay, this is going to feel difficult in the short run, but it is actually better for my wellbeing. So that's one thing. Putting down our social media and then also just even if it's a few times a week or just starting small, choosing those video and phone conversations rather than the mediated connection. So if you have the choice between ordering pizza online versus calling if you don't have a lot of practice, practice in low risk situations. I like to also talk to strangers. And strangers talking to strangers actually gives us a happiness lift. One way I do this is in the elevator at school and oftentimes people have their ears with the EarPods and looking at their screen and we may talk about something very inane like are those cheetos or doritos on the floor of the elevator. However, we end up leaving with a smile and kind of a connection and oftentimes people are just pleasantly surprised that somebody would be interested in chatting with them. Yeah, sometimes those tiny moment almost takes a little bit of bravery, but then once the door is open, people are usually quite happy to have a nice conversation, even if it's brief. And then you have a few dozen nice conversations in a day or two. And now you're working in a nice place, right? You enjoy going to work and you feel like you're part of it. You're okay with that awkwardness at first too, right? So there might be some awkwardness, but that's the thing, it takes practice. Right, great. Well, thank you so much Sarah, for being here.
