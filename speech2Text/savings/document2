Excuse me officer, I think I am lost. Can you help me find my hotel, please?
Certainly, What's the name of your hotel?
It's the GrammarBank Hotel.
Hmm, I think I know where it is.
Is it far?
 No, not really. Do you have a car, are you driving?
 No, I don't have a car.
 Okay, actually it's only about 10 minutes walk. But if you want, I can call you a cab.
 No, thank you. I don't mind walking.
 Okay then, let me give you the directions.
 Thank you. I appreciate that.
 Now, go along this street until you get to the Bank. Do you see the tall building?
 Yeah.
 So, at the traffic lights there, turn left to Great Sheva Avenue.
 Okay, I will turn left.
 Correct. Then go straight on, take the second right and that should take you to the GrammarBank Hotel.
 Okay, I will take the second left.
 No, it's the second right.
 Ah, right. The second right.
 Yes sir, left at the traffic lights near the bank and then the second right.
 Got it, thank you very much for your help.
 No problem, have a nice day.
