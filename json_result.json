Today we have a very special guest, dr. Sarah J. Tracy, a good friend of mine. She's a professor at Arizona State University. She also does speaking and workshops on relationship and connection. So Sarah, thanks for being here. How are you?",

        "text": "Yes. Some of the leading experts actually suggest that we are experiencing an epidemic of loneliness in the United States. And that disconnection rise of social media and a decrease of embodied conversation has something to do with that. Also is increasing communication anxiety. Third of all, people are losing the ability to empathically connect with one another, to actually be able to do perspective taking and see other people's points of view.",

        "text": "Yeah, there's a lot of challenges. It seems like we talked the other day how it's two fold. We're doing less conversation, so we're losing that time building relationships, but also since we're not doing it, we don't have the skills anymore. So that when we actually are face to face, we just don't do it very well. We don't handle it very well. So what's going on today? One of the contributing factors to us losing that ability to connect?",

        "text": "Yeah, one of the things that you pointed to Alex, is just this decrease in practice in having face to face conversations. When you and I were young, we had the family phone and even these sort of inane small conversations of hello, Tracy residence, this is Sarah speaking. And making small talk with our parents friends, my brother's friends, et cetera, gave us that daily practice and people are wearing more and more ear pods, looking at their phones and so on. So whereas we might have passed the time in an airport or on public transportation having these conversations with strangers, we're more likely to be engrossed in our own mediated communication with people we already know are connected to.",

        "text": "Right? Yeah, we're just losing that ability. People get so nervous just to have a common conversation, to just ask a stranger a question like if they're in an unfamiliar part of town or just say hello to them in passing. So we are involved in texting, in social media, clearly lots of email and we're on those a lot. And yet they're not really that good at building these genuine connections. Why is that?",

        "text": "Well, people go to social media intending to connect. However, the research shows that we actually feel worse after being on social media to average per day, by the way, two and a half hours a day that we spend on social media. So obviously, we're craving that connection. But the thing is, on social media, we're more likely to come across these sort of photoshopped pictures. I call it photoshopped lives. Some people have called it curated cells. Like, we curate a museum, we curate our brand as a person. And so this ends up leaving us feeling like our lives in real life are not as great as our friends life. And this social comparison is a happiness killer.",

Compared to everybody else, my life isn't as good. And it's almost like we might go there, like you say, intending to connect, but then instead, we end up pushing out this personal brand. We're marketing ourselves a certain picture, a certain persona that we're pushing out. So I can't really be authentic. I mean, I could in theory, but we don't see that much authenticity. You don't see people having a bad day and using social media to then feel better.",

And so one of the downsides of that too, is we really don't see when other people are suffering. And we are most likely to reach out and connect to someone when we see that they are suffering. So it's almost like the suffering becomes invisible, and then that fuels the disconnection between.",
